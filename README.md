In this project, I build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout is responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

I wrote CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
